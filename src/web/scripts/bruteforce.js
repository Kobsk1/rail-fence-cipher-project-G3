/**
 * BRUTE FORCE ATTACK - CRYPTANALYSIS 
 * 
 * Implements brute force attack by trying all possible keys and
 * using simple heuristics to identify potential plaintext.
 * 
 * DISCRETE STRUCTURES CONCEPTS:
 * - Sets: Iterating through key space {2, 3, 4, ..., n-1}
 * - Combinatorics: Key space size analysis
 * - Algorithm Analysis: O(n^2) complexity discussion
 * - Logic: Validation conditions and scoring
 * 
 * TEAM: Cryptanalysis Specialist
 * TASKS:
 * 1. Implement bruteForce() function
 * 2. Create simple English detection heuristics
 * 3. Display results in user-friendly format
 * 4. Optimize for performance with long texts
