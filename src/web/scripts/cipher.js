/**
 * RAIL FENCE CIPHER - CORE LOGIC (JavaScript Version)
 * 
 * This file contains the core encryption and decryption algorithms
 * ported from Java to JavaScript for web implementation.
 * 
 * DISCRETE STRUCTURES CONCEPTS:
 * - Graph Theory: Zig-zag pattern as graph traversal
 * - Sets & Functions: Position mapping between plaintext and ciphertext
 * - Logic: Direction control using boolean flags
 * 
 * TEAM: Algorithm Specialist
 * TASKS:
 * 1. Implement encrypt() function
 * 2. Implement decrypt() function  
 * 3. Ensure consistency with Java version
 * 4. Test thoroughly with edge cases
