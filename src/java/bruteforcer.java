/**
 * BRUTE FORCE ATTACK IMPLEMENTATION
 * 
 * This class implements a brute-force attack on Rail Fence Cipher by trying all possible keys.
 * 
 * DISCRETE STRUCTURES CONCEPTS:
 * - Sets: The key space {2, 3, 4, ..., n-1}
 * - Combinatorics: Analyzing number of possible keys
 * - Algorithm Analysis: O(n^2) time complexity
 * - Logic: Validation conditions for plaintext detection
 * 
 * TEAM: Cryptanalysis Specialist  
 * TASKS:
 * 1. Implement bruteForceAttack() method
 * 2. Create simple plaintext validation
 * 3. Test with known ciphertexts
 * 4. Port to JavaScript for web version
