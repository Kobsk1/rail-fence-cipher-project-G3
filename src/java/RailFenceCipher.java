/**
 * RAIL FENCE CIPHER - CORE ALGORITHM
 * 
 * This class implements the Rail Fence Cipher encryption and decryption algorithms.
 * 
 * DISCRETE STRUCTURES CONCEPTS:
 * - Graph Theory: The zig-zag pattern represents a graph traversal
 * - Sets & Functions: Encryption defines a function from plaintext to ciphertext positions
 * - Logic: Algorithm uses boolean logic for direction changes
 * 
 * TEAM: Algorithm Specialist
 * TASKS: 
 * 1. Implement encrypt() method
 * 2. Implement decrypt() method  
 * 3. Test with various inputs
 * 4. Port logic to JavaScript later
